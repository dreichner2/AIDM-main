# Daily AIDM Codebase Improvement Audit - 2026-06-14 06:06 MDT

Automation ID: `daily-aidm-codebase-improvement-audit`

Scope: focused safe-improvement pass across frontend bestiary/debug UX, accessibility semantics, backend route capability boundaries, direct session-state writers, campaign-pack encounter-group work already in the worktree, tests, security scanning, and developer workflow checks. The worktree already contained unrelated pending changes in `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`, `aidm_server/game_state/campaign_pack_encounters.py`, `docs/campaign_packs.md`, `docs/examples/the_road_of_unremembered_kings_campaign.json`, `scripts/launch_desktop_app.sh`, `tests/test_campaign_pack_linter.py`, and untracked `tests/test_campaign_pack_encounter_groups.py`; this run preserved those changes and only edited the bestiary frontend/test/style files plus this report.

## What Was Inspected

- Prior dated audit sections in `improvements_suggestions.md`, especially the recurring recommendations around combat/bestiary route authorization, debug payload exposure, direct session snapshot writes, and bestiary UI semantics.
- Frontend bestiary/debug panel:
  - `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/styles/inspector.css`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- Backend combat and bestiary route surface:
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
  - `aidm_server/workspace_access.py`
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/sessions.py`
- Direct session snapshot mutation paths:
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py`
  - `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py`
- Existing campaign-pack encounter-group changes already present in the worktree:
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
  - `aidm_server/game_state/campaign_pack_encounters.py`
  - `tests/test_campaign_pack_encounter_groups.py`
  - `tests/test_campaign_pack_linter.py`
- Developer workflow and safety checks:
  - `Makefile`
  - `aidm_frontend/package.json`
  - `scripts/scan_secrets.py`

## Small Safe Fixes Made

### Keep bestiary browsing available when optional combat debug is unavailable

Affected files:
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx`

Problem:
`BestiaryDebugPanel` loaded core bestiary, campaign bestiary, and combat debug events in one `Promise.all`. Combat debug data is optional, but any debug endpoint error would fail the whole panel and hide normal bestiary browsing. That is especially fragile because combat debug payloads should become admin/DM-only on the backend.

Change:
- Wrapped only the combat debug request in a local fallback that returns `{ events: [] }` when the optional debug fetch fails.
- Preserved normal error handling for core and campaign bestiary requests.
- Added a regression test proving a debug fetch failure does not show an error, does not render debug details, and still leaves bestiary browsing usable.

Rationale:
This is a narrow UX/security-prep fix. It makes future backend restriction of raw combat debug data less disruptive without weakening any current backend behavior.

### Replace invalid bestiary listbox semantics with a normal list of buttons

Affected files:
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
- `aidm_frontend/src/styles/inspector.css`

Problem:
The bestiary creature picker declared `role="listbox"` but rendered plain buttons instead of ARIA `option` children and did not implement listbox keyboard behavior. That creates invalid semantics and unpredictable assistive-technology behavior.

Change:
- Replaced the fake listbox container with a semantic `<ul aria-label="Bestiary creatures">`.
- Wrapped each creature button in an `<li>`.
- Added `aria-pressed` to expose the selected creature button state.
- Adjusted the list CSS to remove browser default bullets/spacing and keep the compact layout.

Rationale:
This is a low-risk accessibility correction that matches the component's actual interaction model: a short list of independent selectable buttons.

## Verification

- `npm run test:unit -- BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx`
  - Passed: 1 test file, 2 tests.
- `npm run typecheck`

  - Passed: 7 tests.
- `./.venv/bin/python scripts/scan_secrets.py aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx aidm_frontend/src/styles/inspector.css`
  - Passed: no likely committed secrets found.

## High-Priority Findings Refreshed This Run

### Critical: Combat mutation, bestiary authoring, and combat debug routes still need DM/admin capability checks

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:352-379` creates campaign/region bestiary entries.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:382-411` generates and optionally saves campaign bestiary packs.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:458-493` evolves a creature and can save it to campaign/session bestiary scope.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:518-614` starts combat, persists combat state, syncs the combat encounter record, and records debug payloads.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:629-656` applies morale events directly to persisted combat state.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:659-690` can apply combat-end state and campaign-pack progress when `apply` is set.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:693-720` accepts arbitrary combat state changes and persists them.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:723-748` returns raw combat debug events.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/sessions.py:570-579` already demonstrates the desired pattern for campaign-pack progress control by rejecting non-admin operators.

Risk:
These routes perform source-of-truth DM/admin actions or expose raw internal debug payloads. A normal table participant in a shared/public deployment could potentially mutate combat state, author hidden bestiary content, start/end combat, or inspect internals.

Recommended next step:
Add route-level tests first: normal player should receive 403 for combat debug, combat start, arbitrary combat state changes, combat-end apply, morale apply, bestiary create/generate/save, and creature evolve/save. Then implement the smallest shared `workspace admin or local unauthenticated owner mode` helper that makes those tests pass.

### High: Bestiary browsing, authoring, and debug UI still share one player-facing panel

Current evidence:
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx` exposes the Bestiary tab through the general inspector.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:147-150` still attempts to load combat debug events when a session is selected, though this run made failures non-blocking.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:263-274` renders campaign-pack seeding controls in the same panel as normal browsing.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:329-338` renders recent combat debug summaries when the backend returns them.

Risk:
Even with the debug fallback fixed, the UI still blends player-safe catalog browsing with DM/admin authoring and debug tools. That makes authorization harder to reason about and increases accidental exposure risk.

Recommended next step:
Split the component into player-safe browsing and operator-only authoring/debug sections. Drive visibility from backend capability fields after backend route gates exist, not from client-side assumptions alone.

### High: Direct session snapshot writers still bypass one serialized mutation boundary

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py:425-462` manually reads session state, applies inventory equipment changes, and writes `session_obj.state_snapshot`.
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py:180-208` writes migrated/progressed campaign-pack state directly.
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py:396-407` writes manually controlled campaign-pack progress directly.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:601`, `:649`, `:674`, and `:705` persist combat/session changes from REST routes outside the normal socket turn coordinator.

Risk:
REST/service writes can still race with active streamed turns and be overwritten by later post-DM persistence. The highest-risk visible symptoms remain equipment, HP/combat state, campaign-pack progress, and projection/canon refreshes that appear applied but later disappear.

Recommended next step:
Create one shared session-state mutation service that acquires the per-session coordinator, reloads inside the lock, applies validated changes, persists through one helper, and records revision/audit metadata. Start with a regression around manual equipment changes surviving a simulated active turn.

### Medium-High: Campaign-pack encounter group support now has duplicated parsing helpers

Current evidence:
- The existing dirty worktree adds `_encounter_enemy_specs` in both `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py` and `aidm_server/game_state/campaign_pack_encounters.py`.
- Targeted tests in `tests/test_campaign_pack_encounter_groups.py` and `tests/test_campaign_pack_linter.py` passed in this run.

Risk:
The behavior currently looks tested, but duplicated parsing logic can drift between the API preview path and the materialized combat-start path. A future change to `enemyGroups`, `enemyIds`, or count precedence could update one path and leave the other inconsistent.

Recommended next step:
After the current campaign-pack work settles, move encounter enemy-spec parsing into one shared campaign-pack utility and keep both API and materializer tests pointed at that shared behavior.

## Larger Suggested Improvements

- Define a route capability matrix for `workspace_admin`, `dm`, `player`, `local_debug`, and `server_owned` operations; enforce it with a small shared helper/decorator.
- Split player-safe bestiary browsing from operator-only campaign bestiary authoring and combat debug inspection.
- Route every `Session.state_snapshot` write through a coordinated mutation service with idempotency, optimistic revision checks, and audit metadata.
- Add a frontend test that simulates backend 403 for operator-only bestiary/debug controls once route capabilities exist.
- Add accessibility coverage for inspector panels, especially tab semantics, selected button states, and compact scrollable lists.
- Consider a compact `make dev-check` target for touched-file secret scan, focused pytest, frontend typecheck/lint, and API contract checks once the current dirty campaign-pack worktree is merged or shelved.

## Notes

- No live backend restart, Tailscale tunnel check, or browser smoke was needed for these frontend-only fixes.
- The campaign-pack encounter-group changes already in the worktree were not edited by this run, but their targeted tests passed.
- The frontend bestiary panel now tolerates a future backend 403 for combat debug events, but the backend route is still not protected.

## Recommended Next Run Focus

1. Add non-admin 403 tests for `/api/sessions/<id>/combat/debug` and `/api/sessions/<id>/combat/apply-state-changes`, then implement the smallest shared capability helper needed to make them pass.
2. Extend the same capability pattern to bestiary create/generate/save and creature evolve/save routes.
3. Add the first concurrency-focused regression for manual equipment updates during an active streamed turn before designing the shared session-state mutation service.
4. Consolidate campaign-pack encounter enemy-spec parsing after the current campaign-pack branch/worktree changes are ready to modify.

# Daily AIDM Codebase Improvement Audit - 2026-06-13 16:04 MDT

Automation ID: `daily-aidm-codebase-improvement-audit`

Scope: focused safe-improvement pass across combat API idempotency, route/security boundaries, direct session snapshot writers, frontend bestiary/debug UX, accessibility semantics, and developer workflow checks. The worktree already contained unrelated pending changes in `aidm_frontend/src/ActionComposer.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/App.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/DiceRollDialog.tsx`, plus an untracked campaign example JSON; this run preserved those changes and only edited the combat API route and its regression test.

## What Was Inspected

- Prior dated audit sections in `improvements_suggestions.md`, especially the recommended focus around `/combat/apply-state-changes`, id-less submitted changes, route authorization, and serialized session-state writes.
- Combat API mutation surface:
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
  - `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`
  - `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`
  - `aidm_server/game_state/models.py`
- Combat endpoint regression coverage in `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`, especially campaign-pack combat start/end, morale, debug-event, and arbitrary state-change API tests.
- Session snapshot mutation paths:
  - `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py`
  - `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py`
  - `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py`
  - `aidm_server/turn_engine.py`
- Frontend bestiary/debug and accessibility exposure:
  - `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/ActionComposer.tsx`
  - `aidm_frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Developer workflow and security scan surfaces:
  - `Makefile`
  - `pytest.ini`
  - `aidm_frontend/package.json`
  - `scripts/scan_secrets.py`

## Small Safe Fix Made

### Synthesize deterministic IDs for id-less combat API state changes

Affected files:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Problem:
`/api/sessions/<session_id>/combat/apply-state-changes` accepted caller-supplied state changes and forwarded them directly into validation. When a submitted change omitted `id`, the existing ledger protection could not reject retries, so an API retry or client double-submit could record another applied change even though it represented the same mutation.

Change:
- Added `_combat_api_changes_with_ids`, which preserves caller-provided `id`/`changeId` values and synthesizes a stable `chg_...` ID only when the route receives an id-less change.
- The generated key is scoped to the session, this API boundary, the batch index, and a canonical JSON fingerprint of the submitted change excluding ID aliases.
- Updated `apply_session_combat_changes` to normalize submitted changes before validation.
- Added a regression test that posts the same id-less combat participant update twice, verifies the first request applies with a generated ID, verifies the second request is rejected as already applied, and confirms the ledger contains only one entry for that generated ID.

Rationale:
This is a narrow correctness/security hardening fix at an untrusted mutation boundary. It does not alter clients that already send IDs, and it uses the existing validator/applier idempotency path rather than inventing new dedupe behavior. Including the batch index avoids unexpectedly collapsing two identical id-less changes inside a single submitted batch.

Verification:
- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py tests/test_creatures_combat.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_creatures_combat.py -k "stable_ids_for_retries or campaign_pack_combat_end_advances_encounter_checkpoint"`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_creatures_combat.py`
- `git diff --check -- aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py tests/test_creatures_combat.py`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/scan_secrets.py aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Result:
All targeted checks passed: 2 focused endpoint tests, 70 creature/combat tests, diff whitespace check, py-compile, and touched-file secret scan.

## High-Priority Findings Refreshed This Run

### Critical: Combat mutation, bestiary authoring, and debug routes still need DM/admin capability checks

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:348-377` generates and optionally saves campaign bestiary packs.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:424-459` evolves a creature and can save it to campaign/session bestiary scope.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:484-580` starts combat, persists combat state, syncs the combat encounter record, and records debug payloads.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:595-622` applies morale events directly to persisted combat state.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:625-656` can apply combat-end state and campaign-pack progress when `apply` is set.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:659-686` accepts arbitrary combat state changes and persists them.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:689-712` returns combat debug event payloads.

Risk:
These are source-of-truth DM/admin actions, but the route layer still exposes them like general session APIs. In a shared table or public deployment, a normal participant could potentially start/end combat, mutate enemy state, seed/evolve hidden bestiary content, or inspect debug internals.

Recommended next step:
Add route-level capability checks and tests before changing all behavior broadly. Start with non-admin 403 coverage for combat debug, combat start, arbitrary combat state mutation, combat-end apply, morale apply, bestiary generation/save, and creature evolve/save routes. Then add an explicit local trusted-development bypass if needed.

### High: Direct session snapshot writers still bypass one serialized mutation boundary

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/turn_engine.py:876` serializes normal socket turns with `session_turn_coordinator.serialized`.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py:421-462` handles manual equip/unequip by reading state, applying changes, and writing `session_obj.state_snapshot` outside that coordinator.
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py:181` and `:208` write migrated/progressed campaign-pack state directly.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:567`, `:615`, `:640`, and `:671` persist combat/session changes directly through the route helper.
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py:1047-1050`, `:1181`, and `:1288-1291` persist normal turn snapshots from captured state.

Risk:
Out-of-band REST/service writes can still race with an active streamed turn and be overwritten by a later post-DM persistence step. The risk is highest for equipment, HP, combat state, campaign-pack progress, and projection/canon refreshes.

Recommended next step:
Create a shared session-state mutation service that acquires the same per-session coordinator, reloads inside the lock, applies validated changes, persists through one helper, and records version/audit metadata. Add a regression that a manual equipment or campaign-pack progress change made during a simulated turn survives final post-DM persistence.

### High: Id-less state changes are now hardened for combat API submissions, but other public mutation boundaries still need review

Current evidence:
- This run normalized id-less submitted changes for `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:659-686`.
- The lower-level validator still only rejects already-applied and duplicate-in-batch IDs when a non-empty ID is present.
- The applier still only skips already-applied changes when `change_id` is non-empty.

Risk:
The most obvious combat API retry path is now covered, but any other public or service boundary that forwards id-less state changes can still bypass ledger dedupe. Centralizing ID requirements would make retries safer across inventory, currency, XP, scene, NPC, and combat updates.

Recommended next step:
Audit every external route/service that calls `validate_state_changes` or `apply_state_changes`. Either require an ID at untrusted boundaries or synthesize a deterministic scoped ID before validation, with route-specific tests.

### Medium-High: Player-facing bestiary UI still mixes catalog browsing with debug/authoring powers

Current evidence:
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx:251-259` exposes the Bestiary tab in the general inspector.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:147-154` fetches combat debug events alongside normal bestiary data.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:203-219` seeds campaign-pack bestiary entries from the same panel.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:325-335` renders recent combat debug summaries.

Risk:
Even after backend authorization is added, the current UI blends player-safe catalog browsing with DM/debug tools. That increases accidental exposure risk and makes it harder to reason about what normal players should see.

Recommended next step:
Split bestiary browsing from DM/admin authoring/debug tools. Drive visibility from explicit backend capability fields rather than client-side convention.

## Larger Suggested Improvements

- Define a route capability matrix for `workspace_admin`, `dm`, `player`, `local_debug`, and `server_owned` actions; enforce it in a shared decorator/helper.
- Route every `Session.state_snapshot` write through a coordinated mutation service with fresh reload, idempotency policy, optimistic revision/audit metadata, and one persistence path.
- Make state change identity mandatory or deterministic at all public mutation boundaries.
- Split combat debug payloads into player-safe summaries and admin-only raw/debug records.
- Add adversarial tests for non-admin combat mutation, debug redaction, bestiary authoring, id-less duplicate submissions outside combat, and snapshot races during streamed turns.
- Add a compact `make dev-check` target that runs script syntax checks, touched-file secret scan, focused backend tests, generated API type check, and frontend typecheck/lint when dependencies are present.
- Clean up bestiary list semantics: `BestiaryDebugPanel` currently uses a `listbox` for catalog browsing, but the content behaves more like a selectable list of cards/details. Prefer plain list/listitem semantics or a fully keyboard-managed listbox.

## Notes

- No live backend restart, Tailscale tunnel check, or browser smoke was needed for this backend API idempotency fix.
- Existing unrelated frontend changes and the untracked campaign JSON were left untouched.
- Broader route authorization and serialized mutation changes were intentionally left as report items because they need role semantics and larger regression coverage.

## Recommended Next Run Focus

1. Add non-admin rejection tests for `/api/sessions/<id>/combat/debug` and `/combat/apply-state-changes`, then implement the smallest shared capability helper needed to make them pass.
2. Audit other direct callers of `validate_state_changes`/`apply_state_changes` for id-less external input and add deterministic IDs where the boundary is untrusted.
3. Add a race-focused regression around manual equipment changes during an active streamed turn before designing the shared mutation service.

# Daily AIDM Codebase Improvement Audit - 2026-06-13 06:04 MDT

Automation ID: `daily-aidm-codebase-improvement-audit`

Scope: focused safe-improvement pass across combat correctness, state mutation integrity, route/security boundaries, frontend debug/UX exposure, tests, and developer workflow. The worktree already contained unrelated pending changes in prompt/provider/runtime/frontend contract areas; this run preserved those changes and only edited the combat validation/application path plus its regression test.

## What Was Inspected

- Prior audit section in `improvements_suggestions.md`, especially the recommended next-run focus around unknown `combat.ability.mark_used` behavior.
- Combat state validation and application:
  - `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`

## Small Safe Fix Made

### Reject unknown combat ability usage before ledger/application

Affected files:
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Problem:
`combat.ability.mark_used` required an `abilityId`, but validation did not confirm that the ability existed on the resolved combat participant. The applier also returned the participant even when no ability matched, so a caller could produce an applied ledger entry that looked like a successful ability use while no cooldown, use count, or `lastUsedRound` changed.

Change:
- Validation now resolves the participant and rejects `combat.ability.mark_used` when the requested `abilityId` is absent from that participant's `abilities`.
- The applier fallback now returns `None` when the participant exists but the ability is missing, so direct internal callers that bypass validation skip the change instead of recording it.
- Added a regression test proving an unknown wolf ability is rejected and does not append a ledger entry.

Rationale:
This is a narrow correctness fix with low product risk. Valid ability usage still follows the existing path; invalid ability usage stops earlier and more honestly. It also supports future cooldown and combat legality work by making ability-use records trustworthy.

Verification:
- `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_creatures_combat.py -k "fine_combat_changes or combat_ability_mark_used"`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_creatures_combat.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_game_state_pipeline.py`
- `git diff --check -- aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Result:
All targeted checks passed: 2 focused combat tests, 67 creature/combat tests, and 151 state-pipeline tests.

## High-Priority Findings Refreshed This Run

### Critical: Combat mutation, bestiary authoring, and debug routes still need DM/admin capability checks

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:318-347` can generate and save campaign bestiary packs.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:394-429` can evolve a creature and save it to campaign/session bestiary scope.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:454-550` starts combat and persists the new combat state.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:565-592` applies morale events directly to session combat state.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:595-626` can apply combat-end state and campaign-pack progress when `apply` is set.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:629-655` accepts caller-supplied combat state changes and persists them.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:658-680` returns combat debug event payloads.

Risk:
These are DM/admin/source-of-truth actions, but the route surface still reads like a general workspace/session API. In shared tables or public deployments, a normal participant could potentially start or end combat, mutate enemy state, seed/evolve hidden bestiary content, or inspect debug internals.

Recommended next step:
Add route-level capability checks and tests before changing behavior broadly. Start with non-admin 403 coverage for combat debug, combat start, arbitrary combat state mutation, combat-end apply, morale apply, and bestiary generation/save/evolve routes. Then add an explicit DM/admin escape hatch for local trusted development.

### High: Direct session snapshot writers still bypass one serialized mutation boundary

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/turn_engine.py:876` serializes normal socket turns with `session_turn_coordinator.serialized`.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py:421-462` reads a session/player equipment state, applies inventory equip/unequip, and commits `session_obj.state_snapshot` outside that coordinator.
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py:181` and `:208` write migrated/progressed campaign-pack state directly.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:537`, `:585`, `:610`, and `:640` persist combat/session changes directly through the route helper.
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py:1048-1050`, `:1181`, and `:1288-1291` persist the normal turn snapshots from captured `state_before_dm`/`final_state`.

Risk:
Out-of-band writes can still race with an active streamed turn and be overwritten by a later post-DM persistence step. This is most dangerous for inventory/equipment, HP, combat, campaign-pack progress, and canon/projection updates.

Recommended next step:
Create a shared session-state mutation service that acquires the same per-session coordinator, reloads inside the lock, applies validated changes, persists through one helper, and records version/audit metadata. Add a regression that equipment or campaign-pack progress changed during a simulated turn survives final post-DM persistence.

### High: Id-less state changes remain repeatable outside ledger protection

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2670-2674` only checks already-applied and duplicate-in-batch IDs when `change_id` is non-empty.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1238-1240` only skips already-applied changes when `change_id` is non-empty.
- Some routes synthesize stable IDs, but the generic mutation boundary still accepts id-less changes from callers that reach it.

Risk:
Retries, double-clicks, or direct API submissions can duplicate effects if they omit IDs. The state ledger then cannot explain, dedupe, or audit the repeated mutation.

Recommended next step:
Require or synthesize deterministic IDs at untrusted mutation boundaries before validation. For direct API routes, derive a scoped idempotency key from session, route/source, actor/participant, change type, target, amount, and relevant state revision.

### Medium-High: Player-facing bestiary UI still mixes catalog browsing with debug/authoring powers

Current evidence:
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx:251-259` exposes the Bestiary tab in the general inspector.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:147-154` fetches combat debug events alongside normal bestiary data.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:203-219` seeds campaign-pack bestiary entries from the same panel.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:325-335` renders recent combat debug summaries in that UI.
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx:597-605` can render combat resolver/debug metadata when debug mode is enabled.

Risk:
Even with backend authorization fixed later, the UX currently blends player-visible catalog browsing with DM/debug tools. That makes accidental exposure and mistaken product expectations more likely.

Recommended next step:
Split the bestiary into player-safe read-only browsing and DM/admin tools. Hide debug event fetches and campaign-pack seeding behind explicit role/capability props from the runtime config/API, not just client-side convention.

## Larger Suggested Improvements

- Define a capability matrix for `workspace_admin`, `dm`, `player`, `local_debug`, and `server_owned` actions, then enforce it in route decorators or a shared policy helper.
- Route all `Session.state_snapshot` writes through one mutation service with the session coordinator, fresh reload, idempotency requirements, and structured audit metadata.
- Make state change identity mandatory at all public mutation boundaries; keep helper/extractor-generated stable IDs as the normal path.
- Split combat debug payloads into player-safe summaries and admin-only raw debug events.
- Add adversarial tests for non-admin combat mutation, debug redaction, bestiary authoring, id-less duplicate submissions, and out-of-band session writes during a turn.
- Add a compact `make dev-check` target that runs script syntax checks, secret scan, focused backend workflow tests, API type generation check, and frontend typecheck/lint when dependencies are present.
- Consider accessibility cleanup for composite widgets in inspector panels: use true list/listitem semantics or plain button groups instead of partially implemented listbox patterns.

## Notes

- No live backend restart, Tailscale tunnel check, or browser smoke was needed for this backend validation/application fix.
- Existing unrelated changes in frontend/API contract/runtime/prompt files were left untouched.
- The broader route authorization and session mutation findings were intentionally not patched in this run because they need role semantics, migration-safe tests, and product decisions around local trusted play versus multiplayer deployments.

## Recommended Next Run Focus

1. Add non-admin rejection tests for `/api/sessions/<id>/combat/debug` and `/combat/apply-state-changes`; implement the smallest shared capability helper needed to make them pass.
2. Add deterministic ID synthesis or rejection at `combat/apply-state-changes` for id-less submitted changes.
3. Add a regression around equipment changes during an active turn to pin down the session snapshot race before designing the shared mutation service.

# Daily AIDM Codebase Improvement Audit - 2026-06-12 21:34 MDT

Automation ID: `daily-aidm-codebase-improvement-audit`

Scope: small safe improvement pass across developer workflow, correctness guardrails, security findings, state mutation architecture, tests, and frontend/admin UX boundaries. This pass intentionally avoided broad combat/security rewrites because the current risks need explicit product/role decisions and more comprehensive regression coverage.

## What Was Inspected

- Existing root audit report in `improvements_suggestions.md`, especially the combat mutation, state race, and idempotency findings.
- Developer workflow entrypoints: `Makefile`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `scripts/check_local_health.sh`, `scripts/run_local_backend.sh`, `scripts/run_unified_local.sh`, `scripts/launch_backend_service.sh`, and `scripts/launch_frontend_service.sh`.
- Secret-scan workflow: `scripts/scan_secrets.py` and `tests/test_secret_scan.py`.
- Local generated artifact hygiene via `git status --short --untracked-files=all`, `git ls-files`, and ignored cache checks.
- Current high-risk combat and state mutation evidence in `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`, `aidm_server/turn_engine.py`, `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`, and `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`.
- README quick-start and frontend package scripts to understand the intended local verification path.

## Small Safe Fix Made

### Make `scripts/check_local_health.sh` repo-root safe

Affected files:
- `scripts/check_local_health.sh`
- `tests/test_check_local_health.py`

Problem:
`scripts/check_local_health.sh` invoked `.venv/bin/python` relative to the caller's current working directory. It worked through `make health` from the repository root, but it was fragile when run directly from another directory, from automation, or from service wrappers. The Python import block also depended on the current directory being the repo root.

Change:
- Added `REPO_ROOT` detection using the script location.
- Added `AIDM_PYTHON` override support, defaulting to `${REPO_ROOT}/.venv/bin/python`.
- Added a clear missing-Python error with the expected install action.
- Changed the script to `cd "${REPO_ROOT}"` before the Python config check.
- Added a focused pytest that runs the health script from a temporary non-repo working directory, stubs `curl`, sets `AIDM_PYTHON` to the active test interpreter, and verifies the expected health URLs.

Rationale:
This is a developer-workflow correctness fix with low product risk. It does not change which endpoints are checked, does not touch runtime state, and is easy to verify without starting backend/frontend services.

Verification:
- `bash -n scripts/check_local_health.sh`
- `for file in scripts/*.sh; do bash -n "$file" || exit 1; done`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_check_local_health.py`
- `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_secret_scan.py tests/test_check_local_health.py`
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/scan_secrets.py scripts/check_local_health.sh tests/test_check_local_health.py`

Result:
All targeted checks passed.

## High-Priority Findings Refreshed This Run

### Critical: Combat mutation and debug endpoints still need DM/admin gating

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:454-550` starts combat and persists a new combat snapshot from the API.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:565-592` applies morale events directly.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:595-626` can apply combat-end state when requested.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:629-655` accepts caller-supplied combat state changes and persists them.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:658-670` exposes combat debug events.

Risk:
Workspace/session visibility is still too broad for DM/admin/debug powers. In public or semi-public play, these endpoints can let ordinary participants alter combat state or inspect internals that should remain hidden.

Recommended next step:
Add route-level capability checks and tests before changing endpoint behavior. Start with non-admin 403 coverage for combat debug, combat start, combat state mutation, morale, combat-end apply, and bestiary generation/save routes.

### High: Direct session snapshot writers still bypass the normal turn coordinator

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/turn_engine.py:875-883` serializes normal socket turns through `session_turn_coordinator`.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:536-549`, `585-591`, `609-617`, and `639-647` read, apply, persist, sync, and commit combat/session state outside that coordinator.

Risk:
REST/debug/service mutations can race with a streamed DM turn and clobber state captured earlier in `stateBeforeDm`. This can drop equipment, HP, combat, quest, or campaign-pack progress changes.

Recommended next step:
Create a shared session state mutation service that acquires the same per-session lock, reloads the session inside the lock, applies validated changes, and records a version/ledger entry. Add a regression test for an equipment or combat mutation during a simulated active turn.

### High: Id-less state changes remain repeatable outside ledger protection

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2630-2666` only checks duplicate IDs when a non-empty `id` exists.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1232-1241` only skips already-applied changes when `change_id` is present.

Risk:
External callers, retries, or client double-submits can duplicate mutable effects when they send id-less state changes. The ledger cannot explain or dedupe those effects.

Recommended next step:
Normalize or require state change identity at the mutation boundary. For untrusted routes, synthesize a deterministic idempotency key scoped to session, actor, route/source, change type, target, and amount, then ledger every applied change.

### Medium-High: Combat ability usage still accepts unknown abilities as applied participant changes

Current evidence:
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1210-1225` returns the participant even when no ability with the requested `abilityId` was found.
- The caller path records `abilityId` on the applied change after receiving a participant.

Risk:
Ability-use records can look successful even when the requested ability was absent. This weakens later work on cooldowns, once-per-combat powers, and combat legality.

Recommended next step:
Add a focused failing test for unknown `combat.ability.mark_used`, then change the applier/validator to reject or skip unknown ability IDs. This is smaller than the broader combat resolver work and is a good candidate for a future safe fix.

## Larger Suggested Improvements

- Define explicit DM/admin/player capabilities and use them consistently for combat, bestiary authoring, debug payloads, generation, and session/world mutation routes.
- Split player-safe combat summaries from admin-only debug payloads; avoid returning resolver internals, hidden plans, helper raw text, or validation logs to normal players.
- Route all live `Session.state_snapshot` writes through one serialized mutation service with optimistic version checks and structured audit metadata.
- Make state change identity mandatory or deterministic before validation/application so retries are safe by default.
- Promote enemy combat intent from advisory text to server-owned executable mechanics over time: roll, resolve, emit state changes, then narrate.
- Add adversarial tests for route authorization, actor ownership, idempotency, snapshot races, unknown/depleted combat abilities, and debug redaction.
- Split `BestiaryDebugPanel` into player-facing bestiary UI and DM/admin tools so normal play does not expose debug affordances.
- Consider adding a lightweight CI job that runs `make secrets`, `bash -n scripts/*.sh`, and the developer-workflow pytest subset.

## Notes

- Generated Python caches and `.DS_Store` files were present in local source directories but are ignored and untracked. No cleanup was performed to avoid destructive filesystem churn during the audit.
- No live backend restart, tunnel verification, or browser UI smoke was needed for this script-only fix.
- No unrelated user changes were reverted.

## Recommended Next Run Focus

1. Add a focused regression test for unknown `combat.ability.mark_used`, then make the applier skip/reject unknown abilities.
2. Add the first non-admin rejection tests around `/api/sessions/<id>/combat/debug` and `/combat/apply-state-changes`.
3. Add shell syntax coverage for all scripts or a `make dev-check` target that bundles secrets, script syntax, and focused workflow tests.

# AIDM Senior Code Review Addendum - 2026-06-12

Note: no active `improvements_suggestions.md` existed in the repository root when this review ran. Existing files were `docs/backend_improvement_suggestions.md` and archived legacy suggestion docs, so this addendum creates the requested target file rather than overwriting older documentation.

Scope: reliability, immersion, state correctness, combat quality, maintainability, security, production readiness, and test coverage. This review is based on current code paths in the working tree, with no code changes made outside this report.

## Review Passes

1. Repo structure and ownership
   - Backend entrypoints and guards: `aidm_server/main.py`, `aidm_server/auth.py`, `aidm_server/workspace_access.py`.
   - State pipeline: `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py`, `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`, `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`, `aidm_server/game_state/extraction/*`.
   - Turn/runtime orchestration: `aidm_server/turn_engine.py`, `aidm_server/turn_coordinator.py`, `aidm_server/socket_contracts.py`, `aidm_server/blueprints/socketio_events.py`.
   - Combat and creatures: `aidm_server/combat/*`, `aidm_server/creatures/*`, `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`.
   - Frontend session and inspector surfaces: `aidm_frontend/src/App.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/SessionBoard.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`, `aidm_frontend/src/useSessionSocket.ts`.
   - Tests: `tests/test_game_state_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`, `tests/test_players_endpoints.py`, `tests/test_socketio_flow.py`, `aidm_frontend/src/*.test.tsx`.

2. Backend APIs, services, models, state mutation, and persistence
   - Normal socket turns are serialized through `session_turn_coordinator`.
   - Several REST endpoints mutate `Session.state_snapshot` directly outside that coordinator.
   - Validation is strong in many player-owned and inventory/currency flows, but several external entrypoints omit the actor context that makes those validations meaningful.

3. DM prompts, helper prompts, extraction, validation, and LLM trust boundaries
   - The pre-DM prompt explicitly forbids deciding success or mutating state.
   - The post-DM prompt asks the helper to extract concrete changes from narration and contains good grounding instructions.
   - The post-DM pipeline assigns stable IDs for helper output and filters some misrouted changes, but the generic validator/application layer still accepts id-less changes from direct callers.

4. Combat and creature behavior systems
   - The intent planner has useful candidate contracts, target scoring, morale, retreat/surrender, boss tactics, and sentient enemy hooks.
   - The current candidate contract primarily selects and summarizes intent. It does not yet execute attack/save/damage/condition mechanics as authoritative server-owned actions.

5. Frontend state display, player UX, debug tools, and API usage
   - The Inspector exposes a Bestiary tab and debug panel as normal player UI.
   - The panel fetches combat debug events and offers campaign pack seeding from the same general inspector area.

6. Security, production readiness, docs, and deployment assumptions
   - API guards enforce workspace token presence when auth is required and set workspace role/admin flags.
   - High-risk combat and bestiary routes mostly rely on workspace visibility rather than DM/admin capability checks.
   - Production safety should treat "can see the workspace/session" as different from "can mutate world/combat source of truth."

7. Tests and verification
   - There is meaningful coverage for happy-path combat planning, state validation, and endpoint behavior.
   - Missing coverage is concentrated around adversarial authorization, concurrent state mutations, direct REST mutation idempotency, and executable combat legality.

## Finding: Combat mutation and debug routes are available to ordinary workspace participants
Severity: Critical
Area: Security / State / Combat / Backend
Files:
- `aidm_server/main.py`
- `aidm_server/workspace_access.py`
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Problem:
Several combat routes behave like DM/admin/debug controls but only require workspace/session visibility. A participant who can reach the session can start combat, apply arbitrary combat state changes, force combat end checks, apply morale events, and read combat debug payloads. The most dangerous route is `POST /api/sessions/<session_id>/combat/apply-state-changes`, which accepts a caller-supplied `changes` list and validates it without an `expected_actor_id`.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/main.py:184-261` applies API guards and sets workspace/admin flags, but does not enforce route-specific capabilities.
- `aidm_server/workspace_access.py:68-72` returns a session when its campaign is visible in the workspace.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:454-545` starts combat from a REST request and persists the new combat snapshot.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:560-582`, `585-611`, and `614-635` apply morale events, combat end changes, and arbitrary state changes directly to the session snapshot.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:638-663` returns full combat debug event payloads for any visible session.
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:1940-1970` only enforces current-player actor ownership when `expected_actor_id` is supplied.
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2414-2450` skips that actor protection when the caller provides no expected actor.
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2393-2417` uses `apply-state-changes` to set an enemy participant to 0 HP and then ends combat through the API.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:147-154` fetches `/combat/debug` from a normal inspector panel load.

Impact on AIDM:
In a public or semi-public table, a player could defeat enemies, force campaign pack progress, alter combat participants, or inspect hidden combat planning/debug data without DM authority. Even if the current local mode is trusted, these routes become a production footgun because "workspace member" and "DM/admin" are different powers. This undermines player trust in combat outcomes and makes the backend less clearly authoritative.

Recommended fix:
Introduce a route-level capability policy for session/world mutation:
- Require `current_account_is_workspace_admin()` or an explicit DM/session-owner role for debug, manual combat start, bestiary seeding, and arbitrary combat state mutation.
- Remove or dev-gate `combat/apply-state-changes`; replace it with narrow, server-owned commands such as "mark enemy defeated by validated resolver result" or "apply morale event from engine."
- When a player-safe route truly needs to mutate state, pass `expected_actor_id=display_actor_id(player_id)` and reject cross-actor changes unless they are generated by a server-owned resolver with a specific source.
- Sanitize or admin-gate combat debug payloads. Player-facing combat summaries should expose only visible telegraphs, not resolver/debug internals.

Suggested tests:
- Non-admin account in the same workspace receives 403 for `/combat/debug`, `/combat/start`, `/combat/apply-state-changes`, `/combat/check-end?apply`, and bestiary seed/generation routes.
- A normal player cannot post `combat.participant.update` for an enemy or another player.
- Admin/DM can perform the same actions and receives audit metadata on the applied change.
- Player-safe combat summary still returns visible telegraphs without debug internals.

## Finding: Out-of-band session snapshot writes can clobber active turns
Severity: High
Area: State / Backend / Database / Architecture
Files:
- `aidm_server/turn_engine.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py`
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
- `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py`
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack_progress.py`
- `aidm_server/services/campaign_pack.py`
- `aidm_server/canon_projection.py`

Problem:
The normal socket turn path serializes work per session, but multiple REST/service paths still read a snapshot, apply changes, and write `Session.state_snapshot` without the same session turn coordinator or a snapshot version check. During a streamed DM turn, these direct writes can race with the turn pipeline's `stateBeforeDm` and post-DM application.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/turn_engine.py:871-879` wraps normal socket turn processing in `session_turn_coordinator.serialized(command.session_id)`.
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py:971-1116` builds `state_before_dm`, applies pre-DM and combat prep changes, and stores that state in turn metadata.
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py:1118-1290` later applies post-DM changes against `state_before_dm`, not necessarily the latest snapshot if another route wrote during the turn.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:536-545`, `579-582`, `599-603`, and `624-635` apply and persist combat changes directly.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/players.py:421-462` handles equipment updates by reading equipment state, applying state changes, assigning `session_obj.state_snapshot`, and committing without the session coordinator.
- `rg` shows additional direct snapshot writers in campaign pack progress, campaign pack import, canon projection, and session lifecycle services.

Impact on AIDM:
A player can equip gear, a debug route can alter combat, or campaign pack progress can update while a DM response is streaming. The post-DM pipeline can then persist an older `stateBeforeDm` plus extracted narration effects, silently dropping the out-of-band update. This is exactly the kind of drift that makes inventory, AC, HP, combat flags, quests, or campaign pack progress feel unreliable.

Recommended fix:
Create one authoritative session state mutation service and route all `Session.state_snapshot` writes through it:
- Acquire `session_turn_coordinator.serialized(session_id)` for every endpoint/service that mutates a live session snapshot.
- Reload the session state inside the lock before validation/application.
- Store and check a snapshot version or `lastUpdatedAt` token for optimistic concurrency.
- For long-running turns, either reject out-of-band mutations with a clear "turn in progress" response or queue them as pending state commands to apply after the turn.
- Keep canon projection and campaign pack progress writes explicitly marked as server-owned and serialized when touching active sessions.

Suggested tests:
- Simulate a turn that captures `stateBeforeDm`, then apply an equipment change before post-DM persistence; assert the equipment change remains in final state.
- Simulate `/combat/apply-state-changes` racing with a normal turn and assert the second writer waits, rejects, or merges deterministically.
- Add a regression test that `lastUpdatedAt` or snapshot version changes cause stale writes to be rejected.
- Verify campaign pack progress updates do not disappear after post-DM state persistence.

## Finding: State change idempotency is optional outside the post-DM extractor
Severity: High
Area: State / Backend / Testing
Files:
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/extraction/post_dm_outcome_extractor.py`
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`

Problem:
The state change ledger only protects changes with an `id`. The post-DM extractor assigns stable turn-scoped IDs, but direct callers can submit id-less changes. Validation and application allow those id-less changes to pass and apply repeatedly, because duplicate detection and ledger append are conditional on a non-empty change ID.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/game_state/extraction/post_dm_outcome_extractor.py:400-417` assigns stable IDs to helper-proposed post-DM changes.
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2441-2479` reads `change_id`, rejects duplicates only when `change_id` is present, and otherwise continues.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1075-1084` skips duplicate detection for id-less changes.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1412-1415` appends to `stateChangeLedger` only when `change_id` is present.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:614-635` passes caller-supplied changes directly from JSON to `validate_state_changes`.

Impact on AIDM:
Retries, double-clicks, client bugs, or manual/debug callers can duplicate damage, healing, gold, XP, loot, scene item removal, quest updates, or combat participant changes. The state ledger then cannot explain what happened because no durable ID was recorded. This can make the table feel arbitrary: the same hit lands twice, gold vanishes twice, or a quest completes through a repeated request.

Recommended fix:
Make change identity mandatory at the validation boundary:
- Reject mutable state changes without an `id`, `source`, and trusted origin, or synthesize a deterministic ID before validation based on session, turn, actor, type, target, amount, and source.
- Treat client-provided IDs from untrusted routes as idempotency keys scoped to session and actor, not global authority.
- Always append ledger entries for applied changes, including synthesized IDs, source, actor, route/turn, and timestamp.
- Add a helper such as `normalize_state_change_identity(state, change, context)` and call it from all mutation services before validation.

Suggested tests:
- Applying the same id-less `health.damage` twice should not double damage after normalization.
- Applying the same id-less `currency.add` or `xp.add` twice should not duplicate rewards.
- `combat/apply-state-changes` rejects external id-less changes or returns the synthesized ID and dedupes on retry.
- Ledger entries include source and route/turn context for applied external state changes.

## Finding: Enemy intent candidates are not yet executable combat actions
Severity: High
Area: Combat / DM Prompting / State
Files:
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py`
- `aidm_server/combat/pipeline.py`
- `aidm_server/combat/state.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/extraction/prompts.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`

Problem:
The combat system has a good candidate/intent layer, but selected enemy actions are still largely advisory. The engine selects an enemy intent and gives the DM required actions/telegraphs; it does not yet resolve attack rolls, saves, damage dice, ability effects, movement costs, or condition application as authoritative server-owned state changes. Post-DM extraction then infers combat outcomes from narration.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py:382-425` builds an `engine_intent_bundle_v1` resolver, but its `actionBundle` contains descriptive steps like `movement_intent`, `use_ability`, and `combat_intent`, not executable state changes or rolls.
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py:428-462` marks candidates as resolvable when broad booleans pass; `action_economy_valid` and `resources_available` are hard-coded true.
- `aidm_server/combat/pipeline.py:449-469` plans enemy intents and returns `combat.intent.set` changes before narration.
- `aidm_server/combat/state.py:482-547` exposes `enemyRequiredActions` and telegraphs to the DM context.
- `aidm_server/game_state/extraction/prompts.py:93-97` then asks the post-DM helper to extract combat participant updates, movement, conditions, ability use, morale, and combat end from the DM response.
- `aidm_server/game_state/orchestration/turn_pipeline.py:1182-1268` merges post-DM extraction and applies those state changes after narration.
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2069-2081` accepts `combat.participant.update` payloads with HP changes as structurally valid if the participant exists.

Impact on AIDM:
Enemies can appear tactical in text while the actual mechanical result depends on whether the DM narration and helper extraction happen to agree. A helper can infer HP changes that were not produced by a roll resolver, or miss damage that the intent implied. This weakens combat fairness, makes enemies feel inconsistent, and keeps the backend from being the source of truth for D&D-like mechanics.

Recommended fix:
Promote the candidate resolver from advisory to executable:
- Add an engine-owned combat action resolver that consumes the selected candidate and current combat state.
- Resolve attack/save/check mechanics server-side: roll, compare AC/DC, compute damage dice, apply resistance/vulnerability if modeled, apply conditions, consume ability resources, and emit validated state changes with roll records.
- Let the LLM choose among legal candidates only when allowed; the LLM should not author final damage or legality.
- Give the DM a compact "resolved combat result" packet to narrate, rather than asking the DM/helper to invent the mechanical result.
- Keep helper extraction as a backstop for purely narrative combat outcomes, not the main authority for enemy turns.

Suggested tests:
- A selected enemy attack against a player rolls against AC and applies exactly the computed damage on hit.
- A miss produces narration context but no HP change.
- A save-based ability applies full/half/no effect according to the ability schema.
- Enemy movement and conditions are emitted as state changes from the resolver, not inferred from DM text.
- The DM response cannot produce extra enemy damage unless it matches a server-owned resolved action ID.

## Finding: Combat ability and resource legality is too shallow
Severity: Medium
Area: Combat / State / Testing
Files:
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py`
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py`
- `aidm_server/creatures/schemas.py`
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Problem:
Combat abilities track cooldowns and `usesRemaining`, but selection and validation mostly check that an ability exists. The planner can select a once-per-combat or depleted ability again, and validation accepts `combat.ability.mark_used` without confirming the ability is present, available, or unused.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/creatures/schemas.py:314-316` preserves `usesRemaining` in normalized abilities.
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py:208-217` selects the first matching special/spell/legendary/lair ability by type/cooldown and does not check `used`, `usesRemaining`, `lastUsedRound`, or recharge state.
- `aidm_server/combat/intent_planner.py:428-462` reports `ability_available` as "ability object exists" and sets `resources_available` true.
- `aidm_server/game_state/validation/validator.py:2102-2107` validates `combat.ability.mark_used` by requiring only `abilityId`.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1060-1068` decrements/marks an ability if found, but returns the participant even if no ability matched.
- `aidm_server/game_state/application/applier.py:1246-1253` treats a returned participant as applied and records the requested `abilityId`.
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2135-2185` covers a successful ability mark-used path but not missing/depleted/used ability rejection.

Impact on AIDM:
Bosses and enemies may reuse limited powers, mark impossible abilities as consumed, or present "legal" candidates that should be blocked. This is especially noticeable for boss tactics, recharge powers, lair actions, and once-per-combat fear/hex abilities. It also makes balance tuning harder because ability frequency is not reliably enforced.

Recommended fix:
Centralize ability availability:
- Add `combat_ability_available(participant, ability_id, round, action_context)` and use it in candidate generation, candidate revalidation, validator, and applier.
- Treat unknown `abilityId` as rejected, not applied.
- Reject or downgrade candidates for `used`, `usesRemaining <= 0`, cooldown not ready, wrong action economy, unavailable reaction/legendary/lair timing, or invalid target type.
- Include resource consumption in the candidate dry run and final state change ledger.

Suggested tests:
- A once-per-combat ability marked used is not selected on a later turn.
- `combat.ability.mark_used` for an unknown ability is rejected or skipped without ledger success.
- `usesRemaining: 0` blocks selection and validation.
- Recharge abilities become available only after a deterministic recharge event.
- Boss/legendary/lair candidates respect action economy and timing.

## Finding: Bestiary and creature generation routes can mutate authored world content without DM/admin gating
Severity: Medium
Area: Security / UX / Architecture / Production Readiness
Files:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
- `aidm_server/creatures/resolver.py`
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`

Problem:
The campaign bestiary is world-authoring data, but creation/generation/evolution routes are available through workspace-scoped APIs and the normal inspector UI. These routes can save generated creatures into a campaign, alter future encounter resolution, and potentially trigger provider work. In production, this should be a DM/admin capability, not a normal player affordance.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:288-315` saves a campaign bestiary entry from request payload.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:318-347` generates a campaign pack and saves entries by default unless `save` is explicitly false.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:350-364` resolves creatures and commits, using the resolver path that can save generated creatures depending on payload/context.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:394-429` evolves a creature and saves by default when `saveGenerated` is not false.
- `aidm_frontend/src/InspectorPanel.tsx:251-259` always exposes the Bestiary tab.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:203-220` calls `/campaigns/<id>/bestiary/generate-pack` from the "Seed" button.
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2424-2454` exercises pack generation, creature evolution, combat start, morale, and debug in one happy-path endpoint test.

Impact on AIDM:
Players can spoil or alter the monster roster, seed off-theme enemies into a campaign, and create persistent content that changes future encounter resolution. In a hosted product, the same routes can also become cost-abuse surfaces if generation calls use helper/provider models. From a UX perspective, visible bestiary/debug controls also break immersion by exposing behind-the-curtain encounter machinery.

Recommended fix:
- Split player-facing bestiary browsing from DM/admin authoring.
- Gate create/generate/evolve/save operations by DM/admin capability.
- Default non-admin resolver calls to `saveGenerated: false` and enforce server-side allowlists for persistence.
- Add per-workspace quotas/rate limits for generation routes beyond generic IP+route limits.
- Move "Seed" and debug controls behind a DM tools mode and hide them for players.

Suggested tests:
- Non-admin cannot create, seed, evolve, or save generated bestiary entries.
- Non-admin resolver calls cannot persist generated creatures even if payload requests saving.
- Admin can seed bestiary and receives a saved entry count.
- Player-facing Bestiary tab, if retained, omits debug events, seed controls, and unrevealed encounter-only entries.

## Finding: Debug payloads store and expose more than player-safe combat summaries
Severity: Medium
Area: Security / UX / Frontend / Backend
Files:
- `aidm_server/creatures/repository.py`
- `aidm_server/combat/pipeline.py`
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py`
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx`

Problem:
Combat debug events persist full debug payloads, and the API returns them directly. The UI currently summarizes only parts of those events, but the raw payload returned by the backend includes resolver and intent planning details that are not player-safe. This is separate from route mutation risk: even read-only debug access can leak enemy plans, encounter resolution methods, hidden objectives, and validation outcomes.

Evidence:
- `aidm_server/creatures/repository.py:199-219` stores a deep copy of the debug payload in `CombatDebugEvent.payload_json`.
- `aidm_server/combat/pipeline.py:621-638` records pre-DM combat debug payloads containing resolver and intent plan data.
- `aidm_server/combat/pipeline.py:673-712` records post-DM combat outcome debug payloads including validation counts, applied/rejected combat changes, and state log.
- `aidm_server/blueprints/creatures.py:638-663` returns `payload: safe_json_loads(row.payload_json, {})` for each debug event.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.tsx:81-117` reads resolver and intent plan fields from those payloads for display.

Impact on AIDM:
A player can inspect enemy intent summaries, resolver methods, hidden mechanics, and validation details. That spoils tactical play and makes the AI DM feel less like an immersive world and more like a visible backend. In production, debug payloads can also accidentally retain prompt-derived or helper-derived text that should not be broadly exposed.

Recommended fix:
- Treat full combat debug payloads as admin-only.
- Add a separate player-safe combat telemetry endpoint that returns only visible telegraphs, current combat status, and public participant summaries.
- Redact helper raw text, resolver internals, candidate backups, and validation internals from any non-admin response.
- Consider time-boxed debug retention and structured redaction before storage if payloads may contain model/provider details.

Suggested tests:
- Non-admin `/combat/debug` returns 403 or a redacted payload without resolver/intent internals.
- Admin `/combat/debug` returns full debug payload.
- Player-safe combat summary includes visible telegraphs but not hidden enemy backup candidates or validation logs.
- Stored debug payload redaction covers helper raw text and provider/model internals if those fields appear in future events.

## Finding: High-risk tests cover success paths but not adversarial invariants
Severity: Medium
Area: Testing / Security / State / Combat
Files:
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py`
- `tests/test_game_state_pipeline.py`
- `tests/test_players_endpoints.py`
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx`

Problem:
The test suite has strong happy-path coverage for combat and state pipeline behavior, but the riskiest invariants are not protected: route authorization, actor ownership on direct mutation routes, id-less retry dedupe, concurrent snapshot writes, and depleted combat abilities. Several current tests prove that powerful endpoints work, but not that the same endpoints are limited to the correct actor/capability or that retries are safe.

Evidence:
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2135-2185` validates normal combat move/condition/ability/morale/round changes, but not invalid ability IDs or depleted resources.
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2393-2417` validates that arbitrary combat participant HP updates can be posted and used to end an encounter.
- `tests/test_creatures_combat.py:2424-2454` validates generation/evolution/morale/debug endpoints together, but not non-admin rejection or redaction.
- `aidm_frontend/src/BestiaryDebugPanel.test.tsx:59-150` validates bestiary filtering, debug summary display, and seeding behavior, but not hiding those controls for non-admin users.
- `tests/test_game_state_pipeline.py` has duplicate ID tests, but current risk remains for id-less direct changes and external route retries.

Impact on AIDM:
Future changes can preserve the current happy path while leaving production-breaking holes intact. The app needs tests that encode table safety rules: players cannot mutate the world outside their character, retries cannot duplicate state, combat mechanics are server-owned, and debug/authoring tools are not player features.

Recommended fix:
Add an adversarial test layer around the existing happy-path tests:
- Route-level auth/capability tests for every session/world mutation endpoint.
- Actor ownership tests for every route that accepts an actor, participant, player, quest, inventory, or currency identifier.
- Idempotency tests for retries and id-less input.
- Concurrency tests for session snapshot writes.
- Combat legality tests for ability availability, action economy, and engine-owned damage.

Suggested tests:
- Non-admin player tries to damage another participant through `/combat/apply-state-changes` and receives 403 or validation rejection.
- Duplicate id-less `health.damage`, `currency.add`, and `xp.add` requests are deduped or rejected.
- Equipment update during a simulated active turn does not disappear after post-DM persistence.
- A used once-per-combat ability cannot be selected, marked used again, or represented as legal.
- Bestiary seed/debug controls are absent for non-admin frontend renders.

## Prioritized Roadmap

### Fix immediately

- Gate combat debug and mutation endpoints by DM/admin capability.
- Disable or dev-only-gate `/combat/apply-state-changes` until it can only apply server-owned commands.
- Require or synthesize state change IDs before application, then ledger every applied mutation.
- Add non-admin rejection tests for combat mutation, combat debug, and bestiary generation.

### Fix before public beta

- Route every live session snapshot mutation through a shared serialized state mutation service.
- Add optimistic snapshot version checks for REST and background writers.
- Redact debug payloads and split admin debug from player-safe combat summaries.
- Gate bestiary create/generate/evolve/save operations and add per-workspace generation quotas.
- Add adversarial retry/concurrency tests around HP, XP, currency, inventory, equipment, and combat state.

### Improve for game quality

- Turn enemy intent candidates into executable server-owned combat actions.
- Resolve attack/save/damage/condition mechanics before narration and give the DM a result packet to narrate.
- Implement ability availability/resource checks across planner, validator, and applier.
- Expand combat tests around morale, fleeing, surrender, objectives, boss abilities, recharge, and target legality.
- Keep helper extraction as a narrative backstop, not the primary source of enemy mechanical results.

### Nice-to-have cleanup

- Rename `BestiaryDebugPanel` or split it into `BestiaryPanel` and `DmCombatDebugPanel` so debug/admin intent is explicit.
- Consolidate scattered snapshot writers behind a narrow service API and document allowed mutation origins.
- Add a short state mutation contract doc explaining trusted sources, actor binding, change IDs, ledger semantics, and concurrency behavior.
- Add frontend role-based fixtures for player, DM/admin, and local no-auth modes.
