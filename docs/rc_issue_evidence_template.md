# RC Issue Evidence Template

Use this when closing RC gate issues. Close the issue only when the evidence
matches the issue acceptance criteria.

To generate issue-ready Markdown from the latest local RC report and source
archive scan:

```bash
make closed-beta-rc
make source-archive
make rc-issue-evidence
make release-evidence-packet
```

The generated snippets are written to `tmp/release/issue-evidence/issue-*.md`.
They intentionally keep hosted/GitHub/manual proof as remaining exceptions until
those external artifacts are attached.

The generated release packet is written to
`tmp/release/release-evidence-packet.md`. Use it as the short RC handoff index:
it records the RC report, issue snippets, source archive, visual-smoke
screenshots and review evidence, GitHub Actions run URL evidence,
hosted RC evidence, security/export-import evidence, deployment-readiness
evidence, beta SLO baseline status, and the remaining external exceptions in
one place.
The manual GitHub Actions `Closed Beta RC` workflow uploads the same handoff
bundle as the `closed-beta-rc-evidence` artifact when those files are produced.

Preview the exact GitHub issue comments without mutating GitHub:

```bash
make post-rc-issue-evidence
```

Post the comments after reviewing them:

```bash
make post-rc-issue-evidence POST_RC_ISSUE_EVIDENCE_ARGS="--post"
```

Closing issues is intentionally separate. `--close` requires `--post`, and it
refuses to close snippets that still list remaining exceptions unless
`--allow-external-exceptions` is passed intentionally.
